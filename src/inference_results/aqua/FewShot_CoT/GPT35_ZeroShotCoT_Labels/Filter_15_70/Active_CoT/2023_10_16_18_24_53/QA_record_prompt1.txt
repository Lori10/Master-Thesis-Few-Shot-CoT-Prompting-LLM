Answer Choices: (A) 1 : 2 : 3 (B) 3 : 2 : 1 (C) 4 : 2 : 3 (D) 2 : 4 : 7 (E) none of these\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the second ratio by cross-multiplying to get z(y + x) = (y)(y + x), which simplifies to y^2 = zx. Next, we can substitute this expression for y^2 into the first ratio to get y/(x - z) = (y + x)/z = x/zx^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get y = x^(3/2)/(x - z) and z = x^(1/2)/(x - z). Now, we can substitute these expressions for y and z into the ratio y^2 : x : z to get x^(3/2)/(x - z)^2 : x : x^(1/2)/(x - z). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(5/2) : x(x - z)^2 : x^(3/2)(x - z). Cancelling out an x from each term, we get x^(3/2) : (x - z)^2 : x^(1/2). Now, we can substitute the expression for z from earlier (z = x^(1/2)/(x - z)) into this ratio to get x^(3/2) : (x - x^(1/2))^2 : x^(1/2). Simplifying this expression, we get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2). Finally, we can simplify the middle term by expanding the square and combining like terms to get x^(3/2) : (x^2 - 2x^(3/2) + x) : x^(1/2) = x^(3/2) : (x^2 - x^(3/2)) : x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none of the given answer choices match the ratio x^(1/2) : (x - 1) : 1. The answer is E.\n\nQ: Three friends-whose walking rates are 1 ft./sec., 3ft./sec.,and 6ft./sec. start together walking in the same direction around a circular track that is 420 feet in circumference.After how many minutes are the three of them together again? Answer Choices: (A) 5 mins (B) 10 mins (C) 15 mins (D) 3 mins (E) 7 mins\n\nA: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each friend to complete one full lap around the track. We can use the formula: time = distance / rate For the friend with a walking rate of 1 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 1 ft./sec. = 420 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 3 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 3 ft./sec. = 140 sec. For the friend with a walking rate of 6 ft./sec., the time to complete one lap is: time = 420 ft. / 6 ft./sec. = 70 sec. Now we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times, which will give us the time it takes for all three friends to be together again. The LCM of 420 sec., 140 sec., and 70 sec. is 420 sec. Converting 420 sec. to minutes, we get: 420 sec. / 60 sec./min. = 7 min. Therefore, the answer is (E) 7 mins. The answer is E.\n\nQ: A jar full of whisky contains 40% alcohol. A part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 19% alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 22%. What quantity of whisky is replaced ? Answer Choices: (A) 1/3 (B) 2/3 (C) 2/5 (D) 3/5 (E) 4/5\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the jar initially contains 100 units of whisky. Out of these 100 units, 40 units are alcohol. Let's say x units of whisky are replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the amount of alcohol in the new mixture will be: 40 - 0.4x (alcohol in the original mixture) + 0.19x (alcohol in the new mixture) The total amount of whisky in the new mixture will be: 100 - x (original amount) + x (new amount) Now, we are given that the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is 22%. So, we can set up the equation: (40 - 0.4x + 0.19x)/(100) = 0.22 Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 2/5 Therefore, 2/5 of the original amount of whisky is replaced with the new whisky containing 19% alcohol. So, the answer is (C) 2/5. The answer is C.\n\nQ: The average of temperatures at noontime from Monday to Friday is 40; the lowest one is 30, what is the possible maximum range of the temperatures? Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 25 (C) 50 (D) 45 (E) 75\n\nA: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that the average temperature from Monday to Friday is 40. Let's call the sum of the temperatures for those five days \"S\". Then we can write: S/5 = 40 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: S = 200 We also know that the lowest temperature is 30. Let's call the highest temperature \"H\". Then the range of temperatures is: H - 30 To find the maximum possible range, we need to find the maximum possible value of H. We know that the sum of the temperatures is 200, so: H + 4(40) = 200 Simplifying, we get: H = 40 So the maximum range of temperatures is: 40 - 30 = 10 Therefore, the answer is (A) 20. The answer is A.\n\nQ: {question}\nA: Let's think step by step."

Then we can set up the equation: P's rate + Q's rate = combined rate 1/10 + 1/2 = x/t Simplifying this equation, we get: 1/5 = x/t Multiplying both sides by t, we get: x = t/5 We know that the total amount of candy in the jar is 10 units, so: x = 10 Substituting x = t/5, we get: t/5 = 10 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: t = 50 Therefore, it would take both of them 50 minutes to empty the jar.

            "Question": "Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's call the number of grams of the health food that need to be eaten daily \"x\". We know that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. So, the amount of vitamin E in x grams of the health food is: 0.09x The amount of vitamin A in x grams of the health food is: 0.08x We want to find the value of x that makes both of these amounts at least equal to the minimum daily requirement of their respective vitamins. Let's call the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E \"E\" and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A \"A\". Then we can write: 0.09x >= E 0.08x >= A We want to find the smallest value of x that satisfies both of these inequalities. To do this, we need to find the larger of the two values E/0.09 and A/0.08, and then round up to the nearest whole number. Let's say that E/0.09 is larger. Then we need to solve the inequality: x >= E/0.09 Multiplying both sides by 0.09, we get: 0.09x >= E Dividing both sides by 0.08, we get: x >= E/0.09 So the smallest value of x that satisfies both inequalities is: x = ceil(max(E/0.09, A/0.08)) where ceil is the ceiling function, which rounds up to the nearest whole number. Let's say that E = 100% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and A = 100% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Then we have: x = ceil(max(100/0.09, 100/0.08)) = ceil(max(1111.11, 1250)) = ceil(1250) = 1250 Therefore, we need to eat 1250 grams of the health food daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. Converting to kilograms, we get: 1250 grams / 1000 = 1.25 kilograms Therefore, the answer is (E) 16.5. The answer is E.",

She is covering 100 km at a rate of 10 km per hour, so she will take 100/10 = 10 hours to cover the distance if she rides continuously without taking any rest breaks. \n\nHowever, we know that she takes a 10-minute rest break after every 15 km. So, in 100 km, she will take 6 rest breaks (since 100/15 = 6 with a remainder of 10). Each rest break is 10 minutes, so the total time she spends taking rest breaks is 6 x 10 = 60 minutes = 1 hour. \n\nTherefore, the total time she will take to cover 100 km is 10 hours (riding time) + 1 hour (rest break time) = 11 hours. \n\nSo, the answer is (C) 11 hours.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's call the number of employees in the organization \"N\". We know that the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contributions from each employee. So, the amount contributed by each employee is: 6 lakh / N We also know that if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. So, the new amount contributed by each employee is: (6.24 lakh) / N We can set up an equation based on these two amounts: (6 lakh / N) + 60 = (6.24 lakh) / N Multiplying both sides by N, we get: 6 lakh + 60N = 6.24 lakh Simplifying, we get: 240N = 24,000 N = 100 Therefore, there are 100 employees in the organization.

We know that the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, so the selling price is 95% of the marked price: 0.95M We also know that if the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. Let's call the profit he earns with a 5% discount \"P1\", and the profit he earns with a 7% discount \"P2\". Then we can write: P1 - 0.05M = P2 - 0.07M Simplifying, we get: 0.02M = P1 - P2 + 15 We also know that the profit earned with a 5% discount is 5% of the selling price: P1 = 0.05(0.95M) = 0.0475M And the profit earned with a 7% discount is 7% of the selling price: P2 = 0.07(0.93M) = 0.0651M Substituting these expressions for P1 and P2 into the equation we derived earlier, we get: 0.02M = 0.0651M - 0.0475M + 15 Simplifying, we get: M = 750 Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7",
            "Pred_Rationale": "We can use Euler's totient function to solve this problem. The totient function, denoted by phi(n), gives the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. For example, phi(10) = 4, since there are four positive integers less than or equal to 10 that are relatively prime to 10: 1, 3, 7, and 9.\n\nWe want to find the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1000. Since 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3, we have phi(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 400. This means that there are 400 numbers in S that are relatively prime to 1000.\n\nThe total number of integers in S is 1000, so the probability of choosing a number that is relatively prime to 1000 is 400/1000 = 2/5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 2/5.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. The manufacturer is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Let's say the original price of a tyre is $100. After the manufacturer's discount, the price becomes: $100 - 20% of $100 = $80 Now, the retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on the price of the tyre. The discount is applied to the discounted price of $80, not the original price of $100. So, the price after the retailer's discount becomes: $80 - 20% of $80 = $64 The total discount is the difference between the original price and the final price, expressed as a percentage of the original price: ($100 - $64)/$100 x 100% = 36% Therefore, the answer is (E) 36%.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We know that the train takes exactly three seconds to enter the tunnel, which is one mile long. This means that the front of the train enters the tunnel at time t=0 and the back of the train enters the tunnel at time t=3 seconds. \n\nWe also know that the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, which is equivalent to 2 miles per minute. Therefore, the length of the train is traveling at a rate of 2 miles per minute for t seconds. \n\nLet's call the length of the train \"L\".

We can use this information to find the other root using the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to -b/a, where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In this case, a = 1 and b = m. So, the sum of the roots is -m/1 = -m. We also know that the product of the roots is equal to c/a, where c is the constant term of the quadratic equation. In this case, c = 22 and a = 1. So, the product of the roots is 22/1 = 22. Since one of the roots is 1.5, the other root must be 22/1.5 = 14.67 (rounded to two decimal places).

At 10:00 am, the dog has eaten 1/3 of the remaining amount, leaving 2/3 of 2/3 = 4/9 of the original amount in the bowl.

Finally, at 12:00 pm, the dog has eaten 1/3 of the remaining amount, leaving 2/3 of 8/27 = 16/81 of the original amount in the bowl. So, the percent of the original food remaining in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is: (16/81) / x * 100% = (16/81) * (1/x) * 100% We don't know the value of x, but we can simplify the expression by noticing that the value of x doesn't matter for finding the percentage.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We know that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. This means that both integers can be written as 11 times some other positive integers. Let's call these other positive integers a and b. Then we have:\n\nFirst integer = 11a\nSecond integer = 11b\n\nWe also know that the least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700. We can use the fact that LCM(a,b) \u00d7 GCF(a,b) = a \u00d7 b to solve for a and b. Substituting in the values we have, we get:\n\nLCM(11a, 11b) \u00d7 11 = 11a \u00d7 11b\n7700 \u00d7 11 = 11a \u00d7 11b\n84700 = 121ab\nab = 700\n\nWe are also given that one of the integers is 350.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the man buys x trousers. Then he spends 70x on trousers. We also know that he spends a total of 810, so he must spend 810 - 70x on shirts. Since each shirt costs 30, the number of shirts he buys is (810 - 70x)/30. We want to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. To do this, we need to find the maximum value of x such that the man spends exactly 810. We can set up the equation: 70x + 30(810 - 70x)/30 = 810 Simplifying, we get: 70x + 810 - 70x = 810 Solving for x, we get: x = 9 Therefore, the man can buy a maximum of 9 trousers. The number of shirts he buys is: (810 - 70(9))/30 = 6 So the ratio of trousers to shirts is: 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. Therefore, the answer is None of the above.",

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi",
            "Pred_Rationale": "The first step is to convert the given rate of rotation from revolutions per minute to radians per second. We know that one revolution is equal to 2\u03c0 radians, so: 300 revolutions per minute = 300 * 2\u03c0 radians per minute To convert to radians per second, we divide by 60: 300 * 2\u03c0 / 60 = 10\u03c0 radians per second This means that the fan blade rotates at a rate of 10\u03c0 radians per second. Now, we can find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade using the formula: distance = rate * time * circumference The distance traveled is the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade as it rotates around the center of the fan. The rate is the rate of rotation in radians per second, which we just found to be 10\u03c0. The time is given as 30 seconds. The circumference of the circle traced out by the point on the edge of the fan blade is 2\u03c0 times the radius, or 20\u03c0 centimeters. So, we have: distance = 10\u03c0 * 30 * 20\u03c0 = 6000\u03c0 square centimeters Simplifying, we get: distance = 6000\u03c0 centimeters Therefore, the answer is (D) 3000\u03c0. The answer is D.",

Then the volume of the cube is: V_cube = a^3 The largest sphere that can fit inside the cube will have a diameter equal to the edge length of the cube. So the diameter of the sphere is also \"a\". The volume of a sphere is given by the formula: V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0r^3, where \"r\" is the radius of the sphere. Since the diameter of the sphere is \"a\", the radius is \"a/2\". So the volume of the sphere is: V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0(a/2)^3 Simplifying this expression, we get: V_sphere = (1/6)\u03c0a^3 Now we can find the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere: V_cube : V_sphere = a^3 : (1/6)\u03c0a^3 = 6/\u03c0 : 1 Therefore, the answer is (E) 8:3.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We can start by finding the time difference between the two trains. Train M travels for 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am) and Train N travels for 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am). So, Train M travels for an extra 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes) compared to Train N. \n\nLet's say the two trains meet after x hours from 7 am (when Train N departs City B). Then, Train M would have traveled for (x + 2) hours (since it departs at 5 am) when the two trains meet. \n\nNow, we can use the fact that the two trains have traveled the same distance when they meet. The distance traveled by Train M in (x + 2) hours is given by the formula: distance = speed x time. Let's say the speed of Train M is S. Then, the distance traveled by Train M is S(x + 2). \n\nSimilarly, the distance traveled by Train N in x hours is given by the formula: distance = speed x time. Let's say the speed of Train N is T. Then, the distance traveled by Train N is T(x). \n\nSince the two trains meet, the distance traveled by Train M is equal to the distance traveled by Train N. So, we can write: \n\nS(x + 2) = T(x) \n\nExpanding this equation, we get: \n\nSx + 2S = Tx \n\nNow, we can use the fact that Train M travels for an extra 30 minutes compared to Train N. Since the speed of Train M is S, the distance it travels in 30 minutes is given by the formula: distance = speed x time = S(0.5) = 0.5S. \n\nSimilarly, the distance traveled by Train N in 30 minutes is given by the formula: distance = speed x time = T(0.5) = 0.5T. \n\nSince the two trains meet, the distance traveled by Train M in 30 minutes is equal to the distance traveled by Train N in 30 minutes. So, we can write: \n\n0.5S = 0.5T \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nS = T \n\nNow, we can substitute this equation into the earlier equation (Sx + 2S = Tx) to get: \n\nSx + 2S = Sx \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n2S = 0 \n\nThis is a contradiction, since S cannot be equal to 0. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem. \n\nThe answer is (E) none of the above.",

Let's find the minimum and maximum values of x.\n\nTo find the minimum value of x, we need to assume that there is no overlap between the groups of students. In other words, we assume that every student is studying a unique subject. Then we can add up the number of students in each group to get:\n\n(1/16)x + (1/10)x + (1/8)x = x/16 + x/10 + x/8 = (13/80)x\n\nWe know that (13/80)x is equal to the total number of students, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(13/80)x = 1000\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 6153.846...\n\nSince x must be a whole number, the minimum value of x is 6154.\n\nTo find the maximum value of x, we need to assume that there is maximum overlap between the groups of students. In other words, we assume that every student is studying all three subjects.

We know that the overall class average is 76, so we can write: (83y + 55z)/x = 76 Multiplying both sides by \"x\", we get: 83y + 55z = 76x We also know that the passing students had an average of 83, so: y = (total passing score)/(number of passing students) = (83y)/y = 83 Similarly, we know that the failing students had an average of 55, so: z = (total failing score)/(number of failing students) = (55z)/z = 55 Now we can substitute these values into the equation we got earlier: 83y + 55z = 76x becomes 83(83) + 55(55) = 76x Solving for \"x\", we get: x = 138 So there are a total of 138 students in the class.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. Train A leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. So, by the time Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A has already covered a distance of 3 hours x 40 kmph = 120 km. Let's call this point of intersection between the two trains as point P. Now, both trains are moving towards each other. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is 40 kmph + 72 kmph = 112 kmph. Let's call the distance between point P and Lucknow as \"d\". The time taken for the two trains to meet each other is: t = d/112 kmph We know that Train B starts from Mumbai Central at 2 pm, which is 3 hours after Train A started at 11 am. So, the total time taken for the two trains to meet each other is: t + 3 hours Now, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time For Train A, the distance travelled from Mumbai Central to point P is 120 km. For Train B, the distance travelled from Mumbai Central to point P is d - 120 km. Setting these two distances equal to each other, we get: 40 kmph x t = 72 kmph x (t - 3) Solving for t, we get: t = 9 hours So, the time taken for the two trains to meet each other is 9 hours. Adding the 3 hours that Train A started earlier, we get a total time of 12 hours. Therefore, the two trains will meet each other at 11 pm on the same day.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that the two ants are moving towards each other, so we can think of this as a combined motion problem. Let's call the distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B \"D\". We know that the total distance between the two farms is 75 cm, so: D + (75 - D) = 75 Simplifying, we get: D = 37.5 So ant A travels 37.5 cm before meeting ant B. Now we can use the formula: distance = rate x time Let's call the time it takes for the two ants to meet \"T\".

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's call the distance between X and Y \"d\". Let's also call the time it takes for Allen and Bob to meet for the first time \"t\". When they meet for the first time, the total distance they cover is d, and the total speed is 54 kmph + 78 kmph = 132 kmph. So we can write: d = 132t Now, when Allen and Bob meet for the second time, they will have covered twice the distance between X and Y, which is 2d. We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time. Let's call the distance Allen covers before they meet for the second time \"x\". Then Bob covers \"x + 48\" before they meet for the second time. We can write two equations based on this information: Allen's distance: x = 54t Bob's distance: 2d - (x + 48) = 78t Simplifying the second equation, we get: 2d - x - 48 = 78t Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate x: 2d - 54t - 48 = 78t Simplifying, we get: 2d = 132t + 48 Solving for d, we get: d = 66t + 24 We also know that d = 132t/2 = 66t. So we can set these two expressions for d equal to each other: 66t + 24 = 66t Solving for t, we get: t = 6 Now we can substitute t = 6 into any of the expressions we derived for d to find the distance between X and Y: d = 132t/2 = 66t = 66(6) = 396 km Therefore, the answer is (E) 48km.

            "Pred_Rationale": "We are given that there are 5 dozen (i.e. 60) toys in a box. So, the total number of toys in a box is 60 x 5 = 300. We are also given that there are 98 boxes in a tempo. So, the total number of toys in a tempo is 300 x 98 = 29400. Therefore, one tempo can lift 29400 toys in one round. To find out how many tempos are needed to lift 29400 toys, we need to divide 29400 by the number of toys that one tempo can lift in one round, which is also 29400. So, the answer is: 29400/29400 = 1.

            "Pred_Rationale": "To travel from M to Q, we need to take a total of 3 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 11 buses. We can think of this as arranging 11 objects (the buses) in a line. The number of ways to do this is 11!, which is a very large number. However, we need to account for the fact that the order of the buses within each leg of the journey (M to N, N to O, etc.) does not matter. So, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the buses within each leg. For example, there are 3! ways to arrange the buses from M to N, 4! ways to arrange the buses from N to O, etc. Therefore, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is: 11! / (3! * 4! * 1! * 3!) = 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 / (3 * 2 * 1) = 11 * 10 * 3 * 4 * 7 * 5 = 46,200.

We can use this information to find the width of the parking space: 2(14) + y = 37 y = 9 So the width of the parking space is also 9 feet.

On the other hand, we have [2x] \u2264 2x and [2y] \u2264 2y, so R(x,y) \u2264 4(x + y). Therefore, if x and y are both integers, we have:\n\nL(x,y) \u2264 3(x + y) < 4(x + y) \u2264 R(x,y)\n\nThis means that L(x,y) < R(x,y) for all integer values of x and y.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where x and y are not both integers.

It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5y. Then we can write:\n\n2x/5y = 2/5\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n10x = 2y\n\ny = 5x\n\nNow, let's find the dimensions of the room. Let's say the length is L and the width is W. Then we can write:\n\nL + W = 5y\n\n2x + W = 5y\n\nW = 5y - 2x\n\nLet's also say that the height of the room is h. Then the area of the four walls is:\n\n2Lh + 2Wh\n\nSubstituting for L and W, we get:\n\n2(5y - h)x + 2(5y - 2x)h = 26000\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n10xy - 2x^2 + 10yh - 4xh = 13000\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n5xy - x^2 + 5yh - 2xh = 6500\n\nNow, we are given that the area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. Let's say the height of the doors and windows is d and the total width is w. Then we can write:\n\nwd = 15\n\nw = 15/d\n\nThe total area of the walls is:\n\n2Lh + 2Wh\n\nSubstituting for L and W, we get:\n\n2(5y - h)x + 2(5y - 2x - w)h = 26000 - 30d\n\nSubstituting for w, we get:\n\n2(5y - h)x + 2(5y - 2x - 15/d)h = 26000 - 30d\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n10xy - 2x^2 + 10yh - 4xh - 30h/d = 13000 - 15d\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n5xy - x^2 + 5yh - 2xh - 15h/d = 6500 - 7.5d\n\nNow, we need to find the value of h that satisfies both equations. We can solve the first equation for y in terms of x:\n\ny = x/5\n\nSubstituting into the second equation, we get:\n\n5x^2 - x^2 + 5(2x)h - 2xh - 15h/d = 6500 - 7.5d\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4x^2 + 40xh/d - 15h/d = 6500 - 7.5d\n\nMultiplying both sides by d, we get:\n\n4dx^2 + 40xh - 15h = 6500d - 7.5d^2\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = (4dx^2 + 6500d - 7.5d^2)/(40x - 15)\n\nWe know that h is positive, so we can eliminate the negative root:\n\nh = (4dx^2 + 6500d - 7.5d^2)/(40x - 15)\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values:\n\nd = 50 cm = 0.5 m\n\ncost of papering = Rs. 260\n\ncost per meter of paper = Rs. 2\n\narea of doors and windows = 15 sq.m\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\nh = (2x^2 + 6500 - 1.875)/(40x - 15)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nh = (2x^2 + 6498.125)/(40x - 15)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that maximizes h. We can do this by taking the derivative of h with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndh/dx = (80x(2x^2 + 6498.125) - (40x - 15)(4x))/((40x - 15)^2) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n320x^3 - 259920x + 97470 = 0\n\nWe can solve this equation numerically to get:\n\nx \u2248 4.2\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation for h, we get:\n\nh \u2248 4.0\n\nTherefore, the height of the room is approximately 4.0 meters.

We know that:\n\na + b + c = 17 (equation 1)\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 (equation 2)\n\nWe also know that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits in reverse order. Let's call the original number \"abc\". Then:\n\nabc - 495 = cba\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as:\n\n100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n99a - 99c = 495\n\nDividing both sides by 99, we get:\n\na - c = 5 (equation 3)\n\nNow we have three equations with three variables.

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on the picnic was \"x\". Then, the amount each person would have to contribute without the four friends would be 96/x. \n\nSince four friends did not turn up, the remaining number of friends would be (x-4). Each of them had to contribute an additional Rs. 4. So, the new amount each person contributed would be (96/x) + 4.\n\nWe can set up an equation using this information: \n\n96/x = (96/x + 4)(x-4)\n\nMultiplying both sides by x(x-4), we get: \n\n96(x-4) = 96(x-4) + 4x(x-4)\n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n384 = 4x^2 - 16x\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get: \n\n96 = x^2 - 4x\n\nRearranging, we get: \n\nx^2 - 4x - 96 = 0\n\nWe can factor this quadratic equation to get: \n\n(x-12)(x+8) = 0\n\nSince the number of friends cannot be negative, the only possible solution is x = 12. \n\nTherefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic was (x-4) = 8. \n\nSo, the answer is (A) 8.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's assume that there are 100 students at Daifu university. Then, 24 students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. Let's call the number of students who are only members of the swim team \"S\", and the number of students who are only members of the chess club \"C\". Then, we can write:\n\n- S + 24 = (100 - S - C) x 0.2\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation represents the number of swim team members who are not members of the chess club. We know that this is equal to 20% of the total number of swim team members, which is (100 - S) x P, where P is the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team. So we can write:\n\n- (100 - S) x 0.2 = S + 24 - C\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n- 20S + 4C = 76\n\nWe also know that the total percentage of all Daifu students who are members of both a chess club and a swim team is 24%. So we can write:\n\n- 24 = C + 24\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n- C = 0\n\nThis means that all students who are members of the chess club are also members of the swim team. So we can simplify the first equation to:\n\n- S + 24 = (100 - S) x 0.2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n- S = 20\n\nSo there are 20 students who are only members of the swim team.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to determine how many quarter-miles we can travel for $5.00, which is the amount we have left after paying the initial $3.50. We can set up an equation: 0.10x + 3.50 = 8.50 - 3.50, where x is the number of quarter-miles we can travel. Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.10x = 5.00, which gives us x = 50. So we can travel 50 quarter-miles with the remaining $5.00. \n\nNow, we need to determine how many quarter-miles we can travel with the initial $3.50. We can set up another equation: 0.10x + 3.50 = 8.50, where x is the number of quarter-miles we can travel. Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.10x = 5.00, which gives us x = 50.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's call the distance between A and B \"D\". We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time it took him to travel from A to B is: t1 = D/70 Once he reached B, he turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. The time it took him to travel from B to A is: t2 = D/90 We are told that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. Let's call the time at which he was 70 miles away from B \"t\". Then we can write: t1 + t - 3 = t2 - t Solving for t, we get: t = (t2 - t1 + 3)/2 Substituting the expressions for t1 and t2, we get: t = (D/90 - D/70 + 3)/2 Simplifying, we get: t = (7D - 9D + 630)/1260 = (630 - 2D)/1260 We also know that when he was 70 miles away from B, he had traveled a total distance of: D + 70 We can use this information to set up another equation: D + 70 = 70t1 + 90(t - t1) Simplifying, we get: D + 70 = 70(D/70) + 90[(630 - 2D)/1260 - D/70] Simplifying further, we get: D + 70 = D + (630 - 2D)/7 - (3/7)(D/2) Multiplying both sides by 7, we get: 7D + 490 = 7D + 630 - 3.5D Simplifying, we get: D = 180 Therefore, the distance between A and B is 180 miles.

Similarly, at most 65% did not take part in the debating session. To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to find the intersection of these two sets.

The maximum number of students who did not attend the prom night is 55% of 200, which is 110. The maximum number of students who did not take part in the debating session is 65% of 200, which is 130. To find the maximum number of students who did not attend the prom night and did not take part in the debating session, we need to subtract the number of students who attended at least one of these events from the total number of students: 200 - (110 + 130) = 200 - 240 = -40 Since we cannot have a negative number of students, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 0.

If he arrives after 5:12 AM, he will miss both trains. \n\nThe total time period during which the man can arrive at the station and catch a train is from 5:00 AM to 5:12 AM, which is 12 minutes. \n\nThe main line train arrives every 10 minutes, so there are 6 possible arrival times for the main line train during this 12-minute period. Similarly, the harbor line train also has 6 possible arrival times during this period. \n\nTherefore, there are a total of 12 possible arrival times for either train during the 12-minute period when the man can catch a train. \n\nSince both trains have the same frequency and are independent of each other, the probability of the man catching the first train that arrives is 1/2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 1.5.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. Let's call the length of the rectangular yard \"L\" and the width \"W\". We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so: L * W = 240 We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. Let's say the unfenced side is the width of the yard. Then the perimeter of the fenced area is: 2L + W - 10 We can set up an equation for the perimeter using the fact that Alice needs to buy fencing for three sides: 2L + 2W - 10 = 3P, where P is the length of fencing needed. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2L + 2W - 3P = 10 We can also use the fact that the area of the yard is 240 square meters to eliminate one of the variables. Solving the equation L * W = 240 for L, we get: L = 240/W Substituting this expression for L into the equation 2L + 2W - 3P = 10, we get: 2(240/W) + 2W - 3P = 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: 480/W + 2W - 10 = 3P Multiplying both sides by W, we get: 480 + 2W^2 - 10W = 3P * W Now we can solve for P: 3P * W = 2W^2 + 10W - 480 3P = (2W^2 + 10W - 480)/W 3P = (W - 16)(2W + 30)/W Since P is a length of fencing, it must be positive. Therefore, we can eliminate the negative solution (W = 16) and solve for the positive solution: 3P = (2W + 30)/W 3P = 2 + 30/W Multiplying both sides by W, we get: 3P * W = 2W + 30 Solving for P, we get: P = (2W + 30)/(3W) Now we can substitute this expression for P into the equation 2L + 2W - 3P = 10 and solve for W: 2L + 2W - 3P = 10 2(240/W) + 2W - 3[(2W + 30)/(3W)] = 10 Simplifying this equation, we get: W^2 - 5W - 144 = 0 Factoring this quadratic equation, we get: (W - 12)(W + 12) = 0 Since W must be positive, we can eliminate the negative solution (W = -12) and solve for the positive solution: W = 12 Now we can use the equation L * W = 240 to solve for L: L * 12 = 240 L = 20 Therefore, the length of fencing needed is: 2L + 2W - 3P = 2(20) + 2(12) - 3[(2(12) + 30)/(3(12))] = 58 meters Therefore, the answer is (A) 58.

Let's call the amount of mixture we remove \"x\". Then we will replace \"x\" with pure sand.

If Sharon can earn enough tips to buy the cake in 5 hours, then she can earn 1/5 of the cost of the cake in one hour. Similarly, if Karen can earn enough tips to buy the cake in 4 hours, then she can earn 1/4 of the cost of the cake in one hour. Let's call the cost of the cake \"C\". Then we can write: Sharon's rate = C/5 per hour Karen's rate = C/4 per hour To find the rate at which they can earn enough tips to buy the cake together, we need to add their rates. So: Sharon and Karen's combined rate = C/5 + C/4 per hour To simplify this expression, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20, so: Sharon and Karen's combined rate = (4C + 5C)/20 per hour = 9C/20 per hour Now we can set up an equation to solve for the number of hours it will take them to earn enough tips to buy the cake together.

In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's first find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there is one water lily initially. We know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days, so after n two-day periods, the number of water lilies will be 2^n. We want to find the value of n such that 2^n = the number of water lilies that will cover the lake, which we'll call L. We know that L = 1 * 2^(60/2) (since it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there is one water lily initially). Simplifying, we get L = 2^30. Now we can solve for n: 2^n = 2^30 Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get: n = 30 So it takes 30 two-day periods, or 60 days, for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there is one water lily initially. Now let's find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there are 64 water lilies initially. We know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days, so after n two-day periods, the number of water lilies will be 64 * 2^n. We want to find the value of n such that 64 * 2^n = the number of water lilies that will cover the lake, which we know is 2^30. Simplifying, we get: 64 * 2^n = 2^30 Dividing both sides by 64, we get: 2^n = 2^25 Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get: n = 25 So it takes 25 two-day periods, or 50 days, for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there are 64 water lilies initially.

Answer Choices: (A) 13x/2 (B) 13x/2 - 6 (C) 13x/24 (D) (13x+1) /24 (E) (13x-12) /24",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Sure, let's break down the problem. We know that each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. So, the width of each picket and the space between it is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches. Let's call the total length of the fence \"L\". Then we can write: L = (number of pickets) x (width of each picket and space) To find the number of pickets, we can use the fact that there are x pickets in the fence. So: (number of pickets) x (width of each picket and space) = x(13/2) Simplifying, we get: (number of pickets) x (width of each picket and space) = 13x/2 Therefore, the length of the fence is: L = 13x/2 To convert this length to feet, we need to divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). So: L (in feet) = (13x/2) / 12 = 13x/24 Therefore, the answer is (C) 13x/24. The answer is C.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The area of the square paper is (20 cm)^2 = 400 sq. cm. The diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. The area of each semi-circle is (1/2)\u03c0r^2 = (1/2)\u03c0(10 cm)^2 = 50\u03c0/2 sq. cm = 25\u03c0 sq. cm. Therefore, the combined area of the two semi-circles is 50\u03c0 sq. cm. When the two semi-circles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the shape of a rectangle with two semi-circles removed from opposite sides. The length of the rectangle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. The width of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the semi-circle, which is 20 cm, minus the side of the square, which is 20 cm, divided by 2.

Once we have selected four points, there is only one way to form a quadrilateral using those four points if the four points are adjacent vertices of the pentagon (i.e., they form a side of the pentagon). There are 5 ways to choose a side of the pentagon. If the four points are not adjacent vertices, then they form a quadrilateral that has one pair of opposite sides that are sides of the pentagon, and one pair of opposite sides that are not sides of the pentagon. There are 5 ways to choose the pair of opposite sides that are sides of the pentagon. Once we have chosen those two sides, there are two ways to choose which of the two remaining vertices to include in the quadrilateral. Therefore, there are 5 x 5 x 2 = 50 ways to form a quadrilateral using four of the points A, B, C, D, and E. However, we have counted each quadrilateral twice (once for each way of choosing the pair of opposite sides that are sides of the pentagon), so we need to divide by 2 to get the number of distinct quadrilaterals. Therefore, the answer is 50/2 = 25. However, we need to subtract the one quadrilateral that is formed by using all five points, since the problem asks for quadrilaterals formed by selecting four of the points. Therefore, the final answer is 25 - 1 = 24. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20.",

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 50 (D) 55 (E) 58",
            "Pred_Rationale": "Let's start by assigning variables to the ages of Joe, his sister, and his father. Let's say Joe's age is J, his sister's age is S, and his father's age is F. We know that:\n\nJ + S + F = 100\n\nWe also know that when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now. Let's call the number of years until Joe is as old as his father \"x\". Then we can write:\n\nS + x = 2S\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = S\n\nSo, when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be S years older than she is now. We can use this information to set up another equation. Let's call the age of Joe's sister when she was as old as her father \"y\". Then we can write:\n\nF + x = 2y\n\nWe can also write an equation for the age of Joe's sister in terms of Joe's age, since we know that Joe's sister is younger than Joe's father. Let's call the age difference between Joe's father and Joe's sister \"z\". Then we can write:\n\nF - z = S\n\nNow we have three equations and three variables. We can solve for F by substituting the other variables into the first equation:\n\nJ + S + F = 100\n\nJ + (F - z) + F = 100\n\n2F + J - z = 100\n\nWe can also substitute the other variables into the second equation:\n\nF + x = 2y\n\nF + S = 2(S + x)\n\nF + S = 2S + 2S\n\nF = 3S - x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for F into the first equation:\n\n2F + J - z = 100\n\n2(3S - x) + J - z = 100\n\n6S - 2x + J - z = 100\n\nWe still have one equation with two variables (J and S), but we can use the fact that Joe's sister is younger than Joe's father to eliminate one of the variables. From the third equation, we know that:\n\nF - z = S\n\nSubstituting the expression for F from above, we get:\n\n(3S - x) - z = S\n\n2S - x = z\n\nSubstituting this expression for z into the equation above, we get:\n\n6S - 2x + J - (2S - x) = 100\n\n4S + 2x + J = 100\n\nNow we have two equations and two variables. We can use the first equation to solve for J in terms of S:\n\nJ = 100 - S - F\n\nJ = 100 - S - (3S - x)\n\nJ = 100 - 4S + x\n\nSubstituting this expression for J into the second equation, we get:\n\n4S + 2x + (100 - 4S + x) = 100\n\n6x = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nThis tells us that Joe is currently the same age as his father, so we can use the first equation to solve for F:\n\nJ + S + F = 100\n\nF = 100 - J - S\n\nWe don't know the exact ages of Joe and his sister, but we do know that their ages add up to 100 - F. Since F is a multiple of 3 (from the equation F = 3S - x), we can try different values of F until we find one that works. Starting with F = 45 (which is the only multiple of 3 among the answer choices), we can solve for J and S:\n\nJ + S + F = 100\n\nJ + S + 45 = 100\n\nJ + S = 55\n\nF = 3S - x\n\n45 = 3S\n\nS = 15\n\nJ = 40\n\nSo the ages of Joe, his sister, and his father are 40, 15, and 45, respectively. We can check that these ages satisfy the other conditions in the problem:\n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father (45), his sister will be twice as old as she is now (30).\n\nWhen Joe is as old as his father (45), his father will be twice as old as his sister was when she was as old as her father (30).",

            "Pred_Rationale": "This is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using Fibonacci numbers. Let's say that the number of ways to reach the top of a staircase with n steps is F(n). If the boy is at the second-to-last step, he can take either one step or two steps to reach the top. If he takes one step, then he has F(n-1) ways to reach the top. If he takes two steps, then he has F(n-2) ways to reach the top. Therefore, the total number of ways to reach the top of a staircase with n steps is the sum of the number of ways to reach the top of a staircase with n-1 steps and the number of ways to reach the top of a staircase with n-2 steps. This is the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci sequence, so we know that F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). Using this recurrence relation, we can calculate F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 2, and then use these values to calculate F(3), F(4), and so on, until we get to F(10), which is the answer to the problem. We can also use the formula for the nth Fibonacci number, which is F(n) = (phi^n - (1-phi)^n)/sqrt(5), where phi is the golden ratio (approximately 1.618). Using this formula, we get F(10) = (phi^10 - (1-phi)^10)/sqrt(5) = (55.003 - 34.997)/sqrt(5) = 20/sqrt(5) = 8.944. Rounding this to the nearest integer, we get 9. Therefore, the answer is (B) 89.

Let's let \"V\" represent the number of files infected by a virus, \"W\" represent the number of files infected by a worm, and \"B\" represent the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. We know that:\n\n- V + W - B = 250 (since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)\n- W - 2.5B = 0.4V (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, and 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)\n\nWe want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm. Let's call this number \"NW\". We know that:\n\n- NW = 250 - W (since all 250 files are either infected by a worm or not infected by a worm)\n\nWe can use the two equations above to solve for V, W, and B. First, we can rearrange the second equation to get:\n\n- W = 2.5B + 0.4V\n\nWe can substitute this expression for W into the first equation to get:\n\n- V + (2.5B + 0.4V) - B = 250\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n- 0.6V + 1.5B = 250\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to get:\n\n- V = (250 - 1.5B)/0.6\n\nWe can substitute this expression for V into the equation W = 2.5B + 0.4V to get:\n\n- W = 2.5B + 0.4[(250 - 1.5B)/0.6]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n- W = 2.5B + 166.67 - 1.67B\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n- W = 0.83B + 166.67\n\nWe can substitute this expression for W into the equation NW = 250 - W to get:\n\n- NW = 83.33 - 0.83B\n\nNow we want to find the value of B that satisfies all of the given conditions. We know that B represents the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, so it must be a non-negative integer. We can try different values of B until we find one that works. Since V + W - B = 250, we know that V + W >= B. Also, since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, we know that V <= 0.5(250) = 125. We can use these two inequalities to limit the values of B that we need to try.\n\nIf we try B = 0, then we get:\n\n- V + W = 250\n- W = 0.83B + 166.67 = 166.67\n\nThis solution doesn't work, since W is not an integer.\n\nIf we try B = 1, then we get:\n\n- V + W >= B\n- V + W - B = 250\n- W = 0.83B + 166.67 = 167.5\n\nThis solution doesn't work, since W is not an integer.\n\nIf we try B = 2, then we get:\n\n- V + W >= B\n- V + W - B = 250\n- W = 0.83B + 166.67 = 168.33\n\nThis solution doesn't work, since W is not an integer.\n\nIf we try B = 3, then we get:\n\n- V + W >= B\n- V + W - B = 250\n- W = 0.83B + 166.67 = 169.17\n\nThis solution doesn't work, since W is not an integer.\n\nIf we try B = 4, then we get:\n\n- V + W >= B\n- V + W - B = 250\n- W = 0.83B + 166.67 = 170\n\nThis solution works, since W is an integer. We can check that this solution satisfies all of the given conditions:\n\n- V + W - B = 250\n- V + W >= B\n- W - 2.5B = 0.4V\n- V <= 125\n\nWe can solve for V and W using the equations we derived earlier:\n\n- V = (250 - 1.5B)/0.6 = (250 - 1.5(4))/0.6 = 116.67\n- W = 0.83B + 166.67 = 170\n\nTherefore, the number of files that were not infected by a worm is:\n\n-",

This means that the time it takes to walk the remaining (S-20) steps is (10 - 1) = 9 minutes, since we stopped for 1 minute. So we can write:\n\n(S-20)/E = 9\n\nFrom the second piece of information, we know that if we walk 10 steps and stop, we reach the bottom in 20 minutes. This means that the time it takes to walk the remaining (S-10) steps is (20 - 1) = 19 minutes, since we stopped for 1 minute.

            "Pred_Rationale": "First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of alloy. The volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the coin) is given by the formula: V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the diameter of the coin is 15 mm, the radius is 7.5 mm. The height is given as 2 mm. So, the volume of the coin is: V = \u03c0(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5\u03c0 mm^3. \n\nNext, we are told that the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver. Let's call the volume of each metal V/2. So, the weight of aluminum in the coin is: (V/2)\u03c1_aluminum, where \u03c1_aluminum is the density of aluminum. Similarly, the weight of silver in the coin is: (V/2)\u03c1_silver, where \u03c1_silver is the density of silver. We are told that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so: \u03c1_silver = 2\u03c1_aluminum. \n\nNow, we can use the weight and volume information to set up an equation: \n\n(V/2)\u03c1_aluminum + (V/2)\u03c1_silver = 30 g \n\nSubstituting \u03c1_silver = 2\u03c1_aluminum, we get: \n\nV\u03c1_aluminum = 30 g \n\nWe are asked to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin with dimensions 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this coin is: V = \u03c0(15)^2(1) = 225\u03c0 mm^3. The density of aluminum is given as 1 g/cm^3, which is equivalent to 1000 kg/m^3 or 0.001 g/mm^3. So, the weight of the pure aluminum coin is: \n\nV\u03c1_aluminum = 225\u03c0(0.001) = 0.225\u03c0 g \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n0.225\u03c0 g \u2248 0.706 g \n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 50 grams.",

            "Pred_Rationale": "The diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal. Let's call the diagonal \"d\". Then we have: d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2 Simplifying, we get: d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225 = 250 Taking the square root of both sides, we get: d = sqrt(250) = 5sqrt(10) Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2d = 10sqrt(10). Rounding to four decimal places, we get: 10sqrt(10) \u2248 31.6228. Therefore, the answer is (E) 20.8888. The answer is E.",
