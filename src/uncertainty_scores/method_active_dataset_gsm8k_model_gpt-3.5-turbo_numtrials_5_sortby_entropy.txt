Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?\nA:",
